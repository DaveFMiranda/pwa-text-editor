# PWA Text Editor

## Description

This is kind of a silly app from a really garbage assignment. Source code came from here: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cautious-meme

That's all I have to say about this. If you're tempted to take away points because this readme isn't very descriptive, go ahead. But after you do, please talk to someone about fixing this assignment. It's unclear what the desired outcome is, the instructions are garbage, and none of it works unless someone checks the package.json at the root and realizes there are no scripts there. Surprise! Not your fault, my friend in central grading, but 2U blew it on this one, and I'm sorry you now have to deal with their failure.
